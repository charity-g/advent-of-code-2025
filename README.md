# Advent of Code

Hey! this was my first time completing an advent of code despite having been attempting this challenge since 2022/2023? 
- it was really helpful that they cut the number of challenges this year from 48 down to 24.
- it was also my first time doing proper leetcode-style questions in C++ and I learned a lot~
- feel much more confident in C++ algorithmns and libraries now :)



# How to use:

- Folder structure below: 
```
.
├── run.sh
├── inputs/
│   ├── # you can input your aoc inputs here
│   └── day1.txt
├── outputs/
│   ├── # you can see the logs after running each program here
│   └── day1.txt 
└── executables/
    └── # generated and run by run.sh
```

To run a specific day, just type the number after it

> ./run 1

To generate your own executable without the run function, use the following commands for C++ v17:
> g++ -std=c++17 day1.cpp -O2 -g -o day1
> .\day1
